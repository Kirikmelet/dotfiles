#+TITLE: My Emacs config 

*Init time : 0.60 (low) / 0.81 (high) seconds (0.43`if daemon) [0.2 if no X11]*

* What's in it

- It has Lsp-Mode installed,

- all the configs are split into different files, which are then called by 'init.el'

- Better-Defaults.el by Technomancy is included ([[https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults/tree/master/better-defaults.el][Source]])

- I also use Gruvbox as the theme, and Fira Code as the font.

- Straight.el instead of Package.el

- Early-init.el is used, shaving startup by 0.4 seconds

And has all the thing you would expect from any Emacs config
