#+TITLE: My Emacs config 

- Init time : 1.1 seconds (0.8`if daemon)

- What's in it

It has Lsp-Mode installed, and all the configs are split into different files,
which are then called by 'init.el'

Better-Defaults.el by Technomancy is included ([[https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults/tree/master/better-defaults.el][Source]])

I also use Gruvbox as the theme, and Fira Code as the font.

And has all the thing you would expect from any Emacs config
